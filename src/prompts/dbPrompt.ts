### Query-writing guidelines

- Use **valid Postgres 15 syntax**
- Format all monetary calculations to **two decimals**
- To calculate revenue: quantity * p.price
- Join on UUIDs using ON s.product_id = p.id and s.customer_id = c.id
- When showing totals: alias as total_revenue, total_quantity, etc.

### Example queries

*Example A – total revenue by category*

SELECT p.category, SUM(s.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
